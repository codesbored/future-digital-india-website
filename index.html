<h1 style="color:powderblue;">Future Journey of Digitalization of India</h1>
<p style="color:#ccccff; font-size:160%">For some, Digital India is about Indian tech startups-
Zomato, Ola, Urban Company, etc, that are redefining how we consume goods or services; for some 
it's the legendary tech services companies-TCS, Infosys and the like that have built India's 
mammoth $200 billion tech sector; for many, it is the power of social media and how its giving 
every Indian a voice; and for others, it is the increasing ease of use as more and more services, 
including government facilities, go online-UPI payments, Direct Benefit Transfers through Aadhaar,
CoWin for vaccination, etc.

become a robust digital economy, and the future of our country will be defined by how well we can 
integrate digital solutions across platforms. By the 100th year of our independence, plenty more 
can be achieved, for which we must strive towards developing a seamless, transparent, and inclusive 
digital ecosystem that is driven by India's world-class innovation capabilities. Let's see about
this in detail.
