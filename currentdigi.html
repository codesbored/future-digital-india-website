        <p style="color:#ccccff; font-size:160%">Digital technologies have advanced more rapidly than any innovation in our history - reaching around 50 per cent of the developing world's population in only two decades and transforming societies. By enhancing connectivity, financial inclusion, access to trade and public services, technology can be a great equaliser.

        <p style="color:#ccccff; font-size:160%">The Government of India has also collaborated with major technology companies worldwide to realise its vision. Google Inc. collaborated with the Indian Railways to set-up free Wi-Fi services at 100 major railway stations in India. Google worked in tandem with RailTel, an Indian PSU, that deals with optic-fibre networks along railway tracks in India that will be used to provide these Wi-Fi services. Microsoft Inc. has worked with the Government of India on the Digital India Initiative, with their most recent contribution being the "Digital Governance Tech Tour". This is a national programme that helps deliver critical AI and intelligent cloud computing skills to Government officials in charge of IT across the nation.
